Description
-----------

This workshop will cover using webhooks with `Bitbucket

<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`__ and reStructuredText will be used to
build the underlying Web site.

This workshop will be taught remotely and broadcast to UC Davis via Google
Hangouts. It will also be streaming on YouTube.
