Within Building:
---------------
1. Walk in the main entrance of the library, go up the first set of stairs.
 
2. Turn right, go up the second set of stairs (follow the arrows to the "Institute of Governmental Affairs")
 
3. Go through the double doors at the top of the stairs and turn left, again following the sign to the Institute of Governmental Affairs.  If you've turned left, you should see a green exit sign against the far wall.  Walk towards it.
 
4. To the right of the exit sign is the door to room 362. Go around the corner to the door right next to the water fountain. That is our room!
